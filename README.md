A project made for [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)  

It's a simple game where you guess a number and the computer guesses a number and the one closest to the actual number wins.  
If you put in a number above 9 it will alert you which is kinda handy.  
Used this to practice how unreadable arrow functions can be.
